# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
I recently worked on a project to build a hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques. By leveraging computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I trained a model to classify different hand gestures from image data. The model analyzes key features such as hand shape, position, and motion to predict gestures accurately, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems
